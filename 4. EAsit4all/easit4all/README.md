EASIT4ALL
=========

Description
-----------

The EASIT4ALL project aims to provide to any person independently of its disability an accessible way  
to use main functionalities of social networks. Thus, Easit4all solution consits of a web interface that merges in a
simple and intuitive way different social networks. Additionally, the tool provides a set of plugins 
that makes it more usable and accessible for the final users (e.g. most common operations or self-configuration of visual features).
The ultimate objective of the tool is the auto-configuration of the application accessible features to the user needs. 
This functionality will be provided thanks to the GPII/Cloud4all framework.

The official website is available at http://www.easit4all.com 

Technicalities
--------------
The Easit4All software solution is a simple java based framework composed of 
three main modules: core, dao and web. The first one contains core components such as configuration, 
controllers, handlers or plugins. The second module contains the data managers and data access objects of the application domain 
and the last module is the web graphical interface and the files to set up the application.
